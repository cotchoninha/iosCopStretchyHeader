	//this property animates changes to the view and allows the dynamic modification of those animations.
	//inside your effect function initialize this property with a built-in UIKit timing curve (try it out setting its parameters with random values to see your output)
	//you want your block to execute your desired blur effect. ***not working?//2//
	//there's a property from UIViewPropertyAnimator where you can determine the intensity of your blur, play with it because you'll need for the next step. ***not working?//3//
	//remember, your animation will only start if you ask it to start.
	//run your code and see  what happens. If you're getting a blurred image that's great! Now let's apply this to what we really want.
	//first remove your code that starts the animation and let's jump to the View Controller to make it animate accordinly with your offset. Follow STEP ‚ë°.‚ë°

//1//UIVisualEffectView class is just like any other view, needs to be added to its superview and have constraints set.
//2//to prevent a retain cicle - [weak self] in üëçüèº
//3//UIViewPropertyAnimator has a property that sets the completion percentage of the animation.
