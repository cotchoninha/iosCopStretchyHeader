import UIKit

class StretchyHeaderCustomLayout: UICollectionViewFlowLayout {
	
	override func layoutAttributesForElements(in rect: CGRect) -> [UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes]? {
		let layoutAttributes = super.layoutAttributesForElements(in: rect)
		
		//(1) loop through your layoutAttributes in order to set the necessary attributes
		
		//(2) check if the represented element of the attributes you're trying to customize is your elementKindSectionHeader, if yes:
		
		//(3) you need to access the collection view frame
		
		//(4) you need to set your attributes frame (try it out first with some random numbers to see what happens). Cool, now that you know how it behaves think of a way to track down the content offset y of your collection view for when you're dragging it down. ***TIP***there are more tips if needed in the end.... (see tip 1 below if you're stuck)
		
		//(5) considering that you want your image to expand when you drag it down you need to set it's height to the result of the attributes frame height + your content offset Y - run your code to see the behaviour (see tip 2 below if you're stuck)
		
		//(6) ok, looks good, but you don't want this top image to loose from the top of the screen, so make sure you fix that. ***TIP*** not working? check the tip in the bottom of the page (see tip 3 below if you're stuck)
		
		//(7) YEI, almost there. Run your code and interact with your collection view. Notice that there's a bug in your UI. Can you figure it out on your own? (see tip 4 below if you're stuck)
		
		//(8) Now jump to the Header View...
		
		return layoutAttributes
	}
}

//***TIPS***//

//1.1// Your collection view has a property for its y offset. Get that and print it out to see your offset changing everytime you drag it down.
//1.2// Not printing all the time? Don't forget to reset your bounds to get it to calculate every time you interact with it - there's a method that returns a boolean to invalidate your layout. (shouldInvalidateLayout)

//2// Don't forget your content offset when dragging it down is negative. So make it sum to your height not subtract ‚úö

//3// Set your frame y to your content Offset‚ìé.

//4// Dragging your collection view up will make your offsetY positive and you don't want that. So, make sure you return the function before it gets positive.üëçüèº
